Difference Factory Pattern and the Abstract Factory Pattern using software-related terms:

**Factory Pattern:**

Imagine you're writing a computer program, and you need to create different types of shapes, such as circles and rectangles.

- In the Factory Pattern, you have a "Shape Factory" class that knows how to create these shapes.
- When your program needs a shape, you ask the Shape Factory to create it for you.
- The Factory Pattern helps you create individual objects (shapes) without worrying about how they're constructed. It's like using a vending machine to get a snack; you select what you want, and the vending machine gives it to you without you needing to know how it's made.

**Abstract Factory Pattern:**

Now, let's say your program has expanded, and you're not just working with shapes; you're also dealing with different colors for those shapes, like red and blue. You want to make sure that when you create a shape, you can also set its color consistently.

- This is where the Abstract Factory Pattern comes in. It helps you create not just shapes but also colors and makes sure they go well together and have a consistent style.
- You have an "Artistic Factory" that knows how to create both shapes and colors with an artistic theme.
- When your program needs a shape with a specific color, you ask the Artistic Factory to create it for you.
- The Abstract Factory Pattern ensures that the shape and color match and belong to the same artistic style.

In software terms:

- The Factory Pattern is like a simple object creation process, where you create different types of objects (shapes).
- The Abstract Factory Pattern is like having a complete system for creating related objects (shapes and colors) in an organized way, ensuring they all match a specific theme or style.

The key difference is that the Factory Pattern deals with creating individual objects, while the Abstract Factory Pattern deals with creating families of related objects that have a consistent style.
